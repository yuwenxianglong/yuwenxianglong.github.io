#### 2. Fourth paradigm for scientific exploration

**Fourth paradigm**: (big) data-driven science

> ‘Originally, there was just experimental science, and then there was theoretical science, with Kepler’s Laws, Newton’s Laws of Motion, Maxwell’s equations, and so on. Then, for many problems, the theoretical models grew too complicated to solve analytically, and people had to start simulating. These simulations have carried us through much of the last half of the last century. At this point, these simulations are generating a whole lot of data, along with a huge increase in data from the exper- imental sciences. People now do not actually look through telescopes. Instead, they are ‘looking’ through large-scale, complex instruments which relay data to datacenters, and only then do they look at the information on their computers.

> The world of science has changed, and there is no question about this. The new model is for the data to be captured by instruments or generated by simulations before being processed by software and for the resulting information or knowledge to be stored in computers. Scientists only get to look at their data fairly late in this pipeline. The techniques and technologies for such data-intensive science are so different that it is worth distinguishing data-intensive science from computational science as a new, fourth paradigm for scientific exploration [4].’—Jim Gray, 2007 [5].

#### 3. Big Data characteristics known as the 'five V's'

**Domain Knowledge** & **Five V's**

* Combination of **mathematics** and **statistics**, **computer science** and **programming**

  > It is largely interdisciplinary being a combination of **mathematics** and **statistics**, **computer science** and **programming**.

* Whole process of data: **production**, **cleaning**, **preparation**, **analysis**

  > Its objective is, roughly speaking, to deal with the whole process of data **production**, **cleaning**, **preparation**, and finally, **analysis**.

* **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**

  > Data science encompasses areas such as Big Data, which deals with large volumes of data, and data mining, which relates to analysis processes to discover patterns and extract knowledge from data, part of the so-called ** Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**.

#### 4. Three generation in computational materials science

* **1st Generation**: The first generation is related to materials property attainment given its structure, using local optimization algorithms, usually based on DFT calculations performed one at a time.

* **2nd Generation**: The second generation is related to crystal structure prediction given a  fixed composition, using global optimization tasks like genetic and evolutionary algorithms.

* **3rd Generation**: The third generation is based on statistical learning. It also enables the discovery of novel compositions, besides much faster predictions of properties and crystalline structures given the vast amount of available physical and chemical data via ML algorithms.
